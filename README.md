# Portfolio

A Portfolio website built on react. Used Sass to create a clean and user friendly design. I utilized media queries to make the website fully responsive on all devices.

# What I Learned

This was a more simple project, but I was still able to improve my skills in using React and CSS. I am getting better at using media queries and even thinking about making a project responsive before I build it.
