        Hello! My name is Phil and I have recently discovered my passion for
        programming. This has led me on a journey to start a career in web
        development. I have been very busy learning and gaining the skills that
        will allow me to provide value at a company. This process has been quite
        enjoyable and I can't even imagine how fulfilling a career as a
        developer will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a background in business and teaching. I received my bachelors in
        business in 2016. I then spent the majority of the previous 5 years,
        teaching children overseas, in schools or online. These past experiences
        have provided me with many transferable skills that will pair well with
        a career in this field.
